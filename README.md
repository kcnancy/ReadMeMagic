## Description
Create a simple, quality, ReadMe with user input using nodejs.
This project needs to meet the following criteria:
- User is prompted for GitHub repository username, which is then diplayed in the Questions section of the generated ReadMe.
- User is prompted for a project title which is then displayed as the title of the generated ReadMe.
- Generated Readme includes a Table of Contents with links to the following sections project description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, license information, and questions.
- User is prompted for input on each of the sections included in the Table of Contents and these responses are populated to the corresponding section of the generated ReadMe.

## Installation
Once a GitHub repo is established npm.init needs to be run in the terminal, this will establish the package.json file in the repo. You will then need to install the inquirer and utils npm packages. You will also need to create an output subfolder, this is where the generated ReadMe will be written to after executing this file. 

## Usage
To use this project to create a Readme you must be in the terminal for the ReadMeMagic folder. In the terminal type node index.js and enter. Respond to each prompted question, to select the License use the arrow keys to highlight the appropriate license and hit enter. The generated ReadMe will be located in the output subfolder. Note that this file is overwritten each time the generator is ran. If you want to save the generated ReadMe it needs to be moved to another file or renamed.
